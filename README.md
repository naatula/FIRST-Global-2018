# FIRST-Global-2018
This repository hosts the source codes controlling robots from the FIRST global 2018 competition

This repository allows teams competing in the First Global 2018 Challenge to share their control codes and learn from each other.

You can submit your team's code via [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). If you don't specify otherwise, we take your code to be MIT-lisenced so that it can be freely studied and reused by other teams.

For clarity you should create a directory as follows:

Team `Country`

 * `OPMode.java` or `OPMode.blk` - Your team's code
 * `README.md` - A few words documenting your code and your robot in general. You can also add a license if you wish. We recommend one of the three licenses listed [here](https://choosealicense.com/).

You can also optionally add any files you want. We encourage you to link to your [Robodex page](https://www.robodex.win).


The `Utils` folder is for any dependencies that may meaningfully be reused by other scripts. This includes drivers.
